# Task 1: Customer & Sales Analysis
## Objective
The objective of Task 1 is to analyze historical transaction and customer data to understand who purchases chips and what drives their spending behavior. The insights from this analysis are intended to inform category strategy, customer targeting, and product assortment decisions.
## Business Questions Addressed
1. Which customer segments contribute the most to total sales?
2. Are higher sales driven by more customers, more units per customer, or higher prices?
3. How do purchasing behaviors differ across life stages and premium segments?
4. Do brand and pack size preferences vary by customer segment?

## Data Preparation
* Performed data quality checks for missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers
* Ensured correct data types and removed non-chip products
* Merged transaction and customer datasets for analysis
* Derived additional features such as pack size and brand name

## Analysis Performed
### Key KPIs Analyzed
* Total sales revenue
* Number of customers
* Units per customer
* Average price per unit

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualized sales and customer distribution across life stage and premium status
* Compared spending behavior across customer segments
* Identified key drivers of sales performance
### Statistical Analysis
Conducted t-tests to validate whether observed differences between customer segments were statistically significant

### Brand & Pack Size Analysis
* Evaluated brand preferences by customer segment
* Analyzed pack size purchasing behavior, with a focus on young and mid-age couples
* Identified larger pack sizes as a key contributor to higher spend in certain segments

## Key Insights
* Sales growth was primarily driven by higher units purchased per customer, not price increases
* Young and mid-age couples represented a high-value segment, contributing disproportionately to total sales
* Premium customers exhibited stronger brand loyalty and higher average spend
* Larger pack sizes played a significant role in driving revenue among family-oriented segments

## Business Impact
* The insights from this analysis provide clear guidance for:
* Targeted promotions toward high-value customer segments
